# tkinter-voting-system-python
A Python tkinter project with sqlite. This Voting System helps to cast votes to candidates and view the poll results
You can create polls, vote in them and view their results. We have used tkinter,sqlite & matplotlib library. You can also project the results in a pie-chart format.
Sqlite is used to create databases and manage the data.

When you create a new poll, a new database is created to store the casted votes.
I have created a sample poll: 'myelection' which incudes 3 candidates
